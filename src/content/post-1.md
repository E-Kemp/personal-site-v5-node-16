## Introduction

Welcome! This blog will mostly be about my professional development, where I detail what I've been learning and highlighting any personal projects or specific contributions to [eLife Sciences](https://github.com/elifesciences) that I'm particularly proud of.

eLife Sciences? Yes, I'm an Open Source Developer for an open access health sciences journal, with the aim of chaning how research is published so we can improve the culture of research - a place that is ripe with toxicity and beurocracy! We don't make money, in fact our aim (well, my team's aim) is to create an open source platform to publish preprint articles, we're effectively giving it away for free!

## What else is there here?

This blog won't **only** be about my software successes, there may also be installments detailing developments in other hobbies, such as climbing or my musical career! I'm excited to see where I can take this website and any future content, see you in the next post!
